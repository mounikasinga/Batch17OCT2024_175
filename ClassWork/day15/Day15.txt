Command Line Arguments
In C programming, the main function can accept command line arguments. These arguments are passed to the program when it is executed and allow users to provide input dynamically.
Explanation:
•	argc: This is the argument count, which stores the number of arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself.
•	argv[]: This is an array of strings (character pointers). It holds the arguments passed to the program.
•	argc will always be at least 1 because the first element of argv[] is the name of the program.
Basic Syntax:
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
•	argc: Number of arguments.
•	argv[]: An array of strings containing the arguments.
Example of Command Line Argument Usage:
./program arg1 arg2 arg3
•	argc will be 4 (because argv[0] is the program name and there are three arguments: arg1, arg2, arg3).
•	argv[0] = ./program
•	argv[1] = arg1
•	argv[2] = arg2
•	argv[3] = arg3
